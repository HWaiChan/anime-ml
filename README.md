# Anime Recommender

This repo is a place where I document my journey to an anime recommender using a variety of different
techniques involving basic content based filtering to more advanced techniques such as collaborative filtering (KNN) and SVD-inspired association.

I also document the struggles I face. Right now it's all in my jupyter notebook but when this journey is over
I will take it out here for people to see :)

## Data
The dataset I plan to use is this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist?select=users_cleaned.csv

Kudos to Azathoth!
